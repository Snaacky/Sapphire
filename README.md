# Sapphire
A trigger bot for CS:GO written in Python.

## Warning
Sapphire comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is a cheat and will most likely get you banned if you attempt to use it on any cheat protected servers. I have only tested Sapphire on private servers with VAC disabled and recommend you do the same. I do not encourage cheating in any form and made this solely to learn more.

## Requirements
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pymem](https://github.com/srounet/Pymem)
* [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)
* [pywin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/?source=navbar)
